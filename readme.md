This plugin for [TiddlyWiki 2.x](https://classic.tiddlywiki.com)
makes it easy to jump from one open tiddler to another via hotkeys and
an interface that also substitutes the "jump" command dropdown.

It also adds quick access to some features, now supporting
hotkeys to close or edit tiddlers from the jump list. See details inside the plugin.

This plugin, like many others, are available to install via [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin) (to find it, install the central collection and YLExtensionsCollection from it).
